Puzzle 1 | (How to Measure 45 minutes using two identical wires?)

How do we measure forty-five minutes using two identical wires, each of which takes an hour to burn? 
We have matchsticks with us. 
The wires burn non-uniformly. 
So, for example, the two halves of wire might burn in 10 minutes and 50 minutes respectively.

Answer: 
If we light a wire, it takes 60 minutes to burn completely. What if we light the wire from both sides? 
It will take exactly half the original time, i.e. 30 minutes to burn completely.

1. 0 minutes – Light wire 1 on both sides and wire 2 on one side. 
2. 30 minutes – wire 1 will be burnt out. Light the other end of the wire 2.
   45 minutes – wire 2 will be burnt out. 
Thus 45 minutes is completely measured.
