Puzzle | Mislabeled Jars

Puzzle: 
There are 3 jars, namely, A, B, C. All of them are mislabeled. 
Following are the labels of each of the jars:

A: Candies
B: Sweets
C: Candies and Sweets (mixed in a random proportion)

You can put your hand in a jar and pick only one eatable at a time. 
Tell the minimum number of eatable(s) that has/have to be picked in order 
to label the jars correctly.

Assume that the shape of the candies and sweets are identical and there is no way 
to differentiate them by touching alone.



Answer: 
1 pick of an eatable is required to correctly label the Jars.

Solution:
You have to pick only one eatable from jar C. 
Suppose the eatable is a candy, then the jar C contains candies only(because all the jars were mislabeled).

Now, since the jar C has candies only, Jar B can contain sweets or mixture. 
But, jar B can contain only the mixture because its label reads “sweets” which is wrong.

Therefore, Jar A contains sweets. Thus the correct labels are:
A: Sweets.
B: Candies and Sweets.
C: Candies.
